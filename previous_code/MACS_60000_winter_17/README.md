# MACS_60000_winter_17
The current directory stores some of my code from MACS 60000/SOCI 40133: Computational Content Analysis course, taught by Dr. James A. Evans in Winter '17 quarter.

Also, please refer to [the seperate repository](https://github.com/bobaekang/CCA_W17_FinalProject) that hosts scripts for my final project for the current course.
